# An investigation into the spatial relationship between COVID-19 mortality and socioeconomic, demographic and health factors in England

## Abstract

Spatial modelling of disease is essential for highlighting health inequalities and identifying appropriate healthcare responses. The variation in COVID-19 mortality rate across England has reinforced the importance of dealing with these inqualiuties. This research aimed to examine the global and local relationship between socioeconomic, demographic and health factors and COVID-19 mortality in England from March 2020 â€“ March 2021.

Previous literature has confirmed the link between COVID-19 and socioeconomic, demographic and health factors and whilst global regression techniques have been applied to studies of England, use of spatial regression has been limited. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MS-GWR) account for the non-stationarity of relationships and have not been applied in any major study to investigate COVID-19 mortality in England.

From the initial fifteen socioeconomic, demographic and health variables, two variables were filtered out during the OLS regression modelling. Spatial regression modelling was performed using GWR (R2 = 0.523) and MS-GWR (R2 = 0.524). R and MGWR were used for model construction and coefficient estimate mapping.

Population over 80, emergency hospital admissions, limiting disability and population non-white were found to be the top four statistically significant positive determinants of COVID-19 mortality rate by the OLS and GWR models. Population non-white, incidence of lung cancer, population density and IMD score were found to be the top four statistically significant positive predictors in the MS-GWR.

In conclusion, analysis of the results provides insight into the spatial variation in the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and socioeconomic, demographic and health factors. Similar techniques could provide useful insights for decision makers. Furthermore, this investigation highlighted how choice of spatial model can influence final results.
